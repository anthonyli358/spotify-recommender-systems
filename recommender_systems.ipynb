This has several advantages including fewer missing values, better scalability during similarity comparison, and that we will be dealing with a much smaller matrix in lower-dimensional space. Note that model-based approaches handle the sparsity of the original matrix better than memory-based ones. An import number is the number of selected factors to factor the user-item matrix. The higher the number of factors, the more precise is the factorization, and the more details of the original matrix which are memorized. Reducing the number of factors increases the model generalization whilst too many factors can lead to overfitting (high variance).\n",
